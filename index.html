    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a recent graduate, eager to apply my skills and knowledge in a
        professional setting. I have hands-on experience in the automotive
        industry through an internship in the assembly and maintenance
        engineering department. This role allowed me to gain practical insights
        and develop a strong foundation in engineering principles. Additionally,
        during my college years, I undertook a design project where I learned
        various programming languages to develop a system for streamlining
        transactions in the registrar's office. I am enthusiastic about continuous
        learning and am excited to contribute to innovative projects in a dynamic
        work environment.
